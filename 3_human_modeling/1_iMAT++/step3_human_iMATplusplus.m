% constructing human tissue specific networks is very computationally
% intensive. it has to be run in a lab server or cluster. For running
% information, see the commands in submitHumanTissue_fast.sh for more
% information. The integration pipeline was integrated into a sinple script
% 'HumanTissue_pipeline_fast.m'

% prior to running the step3, you may want to check
% scripts/makeGeneCategories.m and scripts/DErefinement.m for information
% about making the gene categories for integration

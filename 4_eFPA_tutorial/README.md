NOTICE: To facilitate broad application of our eFPA tool for the community, We are in the process of developing a single master function of eFPA that offers various choices of decay function, computing environment and GPR parsing options and more! We will provide a full new tutorial with the new master function soon.

This temporary tutorial serves as a demonstration of the most basic usage of eFPA. Users may follow this tutorial to perform basic (reaction-level) eFPA analysis of their own data. We provided pre-calculated distance matrix and corresponding GEM for human, C. elegans and yeast models at [our website](http://wormflux.umassmed.edu/download.php). For further assist, please email us at [Xuhang Li](mailto:xuhang.li@umassmed.edu)

## Test eFPA
Please follow <b>"walkthrough_eFPA_generic.m"</b> to get started. 
<br>PS. you only need to download this folder (4_eFPA_tutorial) to do a test run.

To facilitate broad application of our eFPA tool for the community, We are in the process of developing a single master function of eFPA that offers various choices of decay function, computing environment and GPR parsing options and more! We will provide a full new tutorial based on the master function soon.

The tutorial for original FPA can be found at https://github.com/WalhoutLab/MERGE/tree/master/3_FPA.
